# Brainstorming Notes

## Name
*Trickster's Tavern* really charms me so I think we'll keep it unless something else really strikes me.

The existence of *Liar's Bar* makes me feel weird since *Trickster's Tavern* is basically just a thesaurus use away, but I'll ignore that for now

## Digital Only Version

This would be quite far in the future, but it would be fun to think about how a digital version of the game could incorporate new mechanics

1. Class - The Hoarder: Roll as many dice as you need until the total value hits X. When you lose a round, lower the X rather than lose dice
2. Classes with non-standard dice
	- The sky is the limit with this. Don't have any particular ideas with this but I'd be interested to see if doing this would have fun effect on gameplay

could be a good game for local/online coop. Not sure where my morals lie on making this a game purchased upfront vs. trying a freemium model where we could sell cosmetics or something. Surely this would kill as a browser game 

## Quest maps

Slay the Spire / Inscryption Act 1 style map which the player's traverse round by round. It would have different location types which could change the rules of and/or the consequences of winning/losing a round.

This sort of opens up the possibilities of what can play out over the course of a game as opposed to the simple last person standing ruleset. It also seems flexible enough since the consequences for losing can always be defaulted to losing a die as in the normal rules. This is also a mechanism for the use of ability and field effect cards.

Examples of quest locations:

1. **Monster Encounter:**
	1. The monster/s roll their own dice hidden, but do not make bets
	2. The winner of the round gets some reward for defeating the monster
	3. The loser of the round suffers a penalty
2. **Environment:**
	1. The rules of betting change based on the rules of the card
3. **Trap:**
	1. Similar to a monster, but there is just a penalty for losing
4. **Safe Room/Ally:**
	1. All players gain a positive effect.
	2. Loss penalties are reduced or negated for this round 
5. **Treasure Room:**
	1. Similar to a Trap, but mostly just a benefit for winning
6. **Final Boss:**
	1. The defacto end point of the adventure. Sets rules which will very quickly determine the winner of the game

Needs a lot of playtesting. I need make sure the base of the game plays well before getting to this
