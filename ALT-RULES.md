# Popular Variant Rules

From my research, here are the popular rule variants you can try out

1. **Ones are Wild:** Ones are treated as dice of any value and are always added to the amount when dice are revealed. Players can also bet how many wilds are at the table.
2. **Spot-On:** A player may call “Spot on” if they believe the last bet is exactly correct. A spot-on call is correct if there is exactly the amount of the face value specified at the table. If the call is incorrect the person who declared the bid spot-on loses a die. If the call is correct every other player except the bidder and the caller lose one die.
		1. **subvariant:** If correct: the caller (or sometimes the bettor) gains 1 die, but no one else loses a die. They start the next round. (Jonti or Calza rule)
3. **Exact Bid (From Bluff):** If a bid is challenged, but the bettor is exactly correct, all players except them lose a die.
	1. **Subvariant:** This can not bring your die total to less than 1
	2.  **Subvariant (Josh Rule from forum post):** The bettor gains a die, or takes the die lost by the challenger.
4. **Winner Starts (Richard Borg):** After a round starts, the winner (rather than the loser) starts.
5. **Free Challenge:** Challenges can be made by any player.
6. **Reveal and Reroll (Bluff & Liar’s Dice & Perudo):** After making a bet, a player may reveal any number of their dice. They may then reroll the rest of their dice in secret.
7. **Palafico(Perudo):** When players lose their fourth die (i.e., they have only one die remaining), they declare themselves "Palafico." For the next round, there are three special rules:
	1. Aces are not wild, for this round only;
	2. The player who is Palafico starts the round, and may start by bidding aces (this is the only time that a player may start with aces);
	3. The rest of the players must increase the bid by raising the quantity, or they may call "Dudo." In other words, players must bid the same number that the Palafico player bid; they may not change the number. There is one exception-. players who have already been Palafico may change the number when it is their turn to bid. Other players must then bid this number.
	4. These special Palafico rules do not apply when only two players are left in the game.

## Thoughts on Variants

(Rule 1) Wildcard ones and (6) Reveal and Reroll I think add the most to the game strategically. Some variations on (2 & 3) exact call rules are interesting but the risk, rewards, and incentives for calling out or challenging exact bets are mixed. At first glance, it seems that some variants of (2) “Spot on”would incentivize players to always call spot-on rather than challenge.  Additionally it seems strange for (3) exact bid rules for anyone but the challenger to be punished.

All the other variants I think could be interesting to incorporate somehow besides maybe (7) Palafico. It just seems a bit too complex and niche. (5) Free challenge does not make much sense to me unless turn orders are also free somehow. I read somewhere about free turn order, but I don’t think it makes sense as it would encourage people to never bet nor challenge. (6) winner starts seems like it makes uneven games more uneven which does not seem preferable in a party game context. 

# Alternate Elimination system

*Authors Note: You know I made this Russian Roulette style rule in 2022 before Liar's Bar existed? It doesn't really count for anything but I just wanted you to know. ALSO, in this variant there is only one gun on the table that all players use, which I think is much more interesting.*

**Revolver:** Instead of losing a die upon losing a round, the player must roll a die. If they roll a one, they lose the game. If they roll greater than one, they stay in the game. Each time this roll is made without eliminating a player, the minimum number needed to roll to stay in the game increases by one. Each time a player is eliminated, the minimum number needed to stay in the game decreases by one.

This seems like a higher variance way of eliminating players, but could be interesting if people want faster games and means that every round is played by players with all their dice.
